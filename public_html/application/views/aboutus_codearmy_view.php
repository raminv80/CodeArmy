		CodeAr.my looks beyond tomorrow - at the new paradigm of work. Putting 'work' back into 'fun' - facilitating global outsourcing through a level of interaction and security previously not experienced. It links committed, motivated and uniquely-skilled people together for the successful completion of an array of project types. Put simply - the right people, the right time, the right price - who can actually do the job! It is not only a job search engine, it is an entire search, activation, execution and management tool to ensure the best and most secure results for everyone involved. Embedding principles associated with gamification, the CodeAr.my platform creates a fun, yet challenging project environment for talent and employers. <br />
		<br />
		<img src="/public/images/codeArmy/content/codearmy-about.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 0 0 10px 20px;" /> CodeAr.my not only connects the two parties together, but it helps the parties manage the entire process from bid notification and acceptance, through the various communication processes required, to testing and approving tasks undertaken, and ultimately payment and ongoing recommendations of both parties. Multifunctional, it allows for and facilitates multiple freelancers to work together on a project, and facilitates the communication and level of integration needed to make this successful. This added advantage eliminates an issue often associated with globally-integrated projects - that of real time communication and being in constant touch with all parties involved. <br />
		<br />
		CodeAr.my's strategic advantage is that parties can participate from anywhere - as long as there is an internet connection. It is designed to allow for people to run their lifestyle and work from places that traditionally employers may not have considered, and also facilitates the ability to work on an ongoing basis - for example, over a travel period, or for a person who enjoys a more nomadic lifestyle travelling around, but still desiring to be supported by an income. <br />
		<br />
		Participants will be part of the new generation that reimagines and reshapes how we work. The early key words were freelancing, hot-desking, and virtual offices. Today, the new key word in the way we work in the IT industry is CodeAr.my. <br />
